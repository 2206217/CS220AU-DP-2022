## **What is digitalisation**

Digitalisation refers to the many domains of social life being restructured around digital communication and media infrastructure. This phenomenon involves taking a step beyond classic digitization - such as multimedia usage and involves transforming societyâ€™s mentality and attitude towards the digital world, not only the organisational aspects of this. With each social institution adapting to this process, the digitalisation of society becomes more complex and more intertwined with our human experience. Eventually, the potential of the human experience being solely digitised will become a new reality. We may then start to see the negative impacts these advances have on the way we exist and interact with others.
